# Timbro

A service by **Witkowski Design**.

Digital stamp cards for cafés, bakeries and shops, with help on the design and marketing. Customers scan a QR code and save the card in Apple Wallet or Google Wallet, and staff stamp it with their phone's camera. Everything is in Italian and English.

*Timbro* is a working name (Italian for "stamp"). To rename it, change `brand` in `assets/js/config.js` and the word "Timbro" in the HTML files.

### Print files (`print/`)

- `brochure-the-coffee-it.pdf`, `brochure-the-coffee-en.pdf`: A5, 4 pages, personalised for The Coffee. For a print shop: "pieghevole A4 → A5, carta 170 g opaca".
- `brochure-the-coffee-it-a4-da-piegare.pdf`: the same on 2 A4 sheets for a home printer. Print double-sided, "flip on short edge", then fold.
- `brochure-generale-it.pdf`, `brochure-general-en.pdf`: no café name, for leaving anywhere.
- `poster-the-coffee-a5.pdf`: the counter poster for The Coffee.

To make a brochure for another café, open `sales/brochure.html`, type the café's name and your phone/email, then press "Stampa / Salva PDF".

## Before printing or sending anything

1. **The site is online** at https://timbro.witkowskidesign.com/ (GitHub Pages from `claude/loopy-loyalty-pricing-redesign-yg54mp`, custom domain in `CNAME`, DNS on Cloudflare). `siteUrl` in `assets/js/config.js` and every printed QR code point there. The old address (bartekarchi56.github.io/witkowskidesign/) forwards to it.
2. **Fill in `contact`** (phone, email) in `assets/js/config.js`, or type them into the brochure page before printing.
3. **Check the prices and plans** in `config.js`: €10 / €20 / €30 a month, 30 days free, yearly = 10 months (€100 / €200 / €300).
4. Regenerate the PDFs after any change: `node print/make-pdfs.js` (or open the brochure page and save as PDF).

## Run it locally

No build step:

```
npx http-server -p 8080
```

Open http://localhost:8080. The stamper camera needs `localhost` or HTTPS.

**Try the whole flow:** website → type a café name → "Crea questa carta" → Stampa → "Apri la carta come un cliente" → join → Stamper → type the 6-letter code → Aggiungi un timbro.

## How design works

It depends on the plan (`design` in `assets/js/config.js`):

- **Start, self customisation:** the owner changes the logo, colours, background (colour or photo) and stamp (shape or their own artwork), with a message for you. Each change is a **proposal**: customers keep seeing the current design until you open the Studio and press "Approva e pubblica", or send it back with "Chiedi una modifica".
- **Plus and Pro, custom design:** Witkowski Design designs the card in the **Studio** (`studio/`): styles, fonts, stamp shape and mark, colours, and your own stamp artwork and background images. Owners have no design controls; they send you a request in words from the dashboard, which appears in the Studio's "To review" list.

On both plans owners can attach up to 8 **images and inspiration** (photos of the place, cups, cards they like) and inspiration links; you see them in the Studio next to their message and can download them.

Text changes (name, reward, number of stamps) always save straight away.

In the prototype the Studio has no login and reads proposals from the same browser. With the server, it gets a login and sees every café's proposals.

## Status

**Demo or connected.** With `supabase` empty in `assets/js/config.js`, the site is a demo: data stays in each browser. Fill it in (see [supabase/README.md](supabase/README.md)) and the customer card, the till phones, the dashboard and the Studio share one database, with logins:
- owners sign up with email; you are the designer via the `admins` table;
- till phones are linked once from the dashboard's **Cassa** tab (QR code, no account), and can be unlinked;
- customers' cards are protected by a secret kept on their phone.

The database is connected (project `xchpnvadjxonhnknywis`). The Coffee's example (`?card=the-coffee`, listed in `demoCards`) always stays a browser demo, so the QR codes on the printed brochures keep working. Add `?demo` to any page to open it as a demo.

 The cards are drawn exactly like Apple Wallet and Google Wallet passes, and `wallet/` creates the real ones; it switches on once you add your Apple and Google accounts (see `wallet/README.md`). Live stamp updates inside Wallet and reminder messages need the database. See [docs/HOW-IT-WORKS.md](docs/HOW-IT-WORKS.md) for how the service works and the roadmap to launch (server, wallets, payments).

## Editing

- Name, contact, prices, plans, starter templates and the starting styles used in the Studio: `assets/js/config.js`
- Design controls (shared by dashboard and Studio): `assets/js/design-editor.js`
- Colours and fonts: top of `assets/css/base.css` (one colour only: `--pop`, the ink blue)
- Ready-made posts, messages and the launch plan: `assets/js/marketing.js`
- Sales emails and the in-person script: `sales/outreach.html`
